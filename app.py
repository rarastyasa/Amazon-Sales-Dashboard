    The best-selling product category is **Shirts**, with a total of **49,764** units sold. The second most popular category is **T-Shirts**, with **46,265** units sold, showing that apparel dominates customer preferences during the observed period.

    On the other hand, the category with the lowest number of orders is **Watches**, with only **3 units sold**, indicating that demand for accessories is significantly lower compared to clothing items. This trend suggests that customers primarily purchase essential or frequently worn apparel, while luxury or accessory items such as watches receive far less attention.

    From a business perspective, these insights highlight the importance of prioritizing inventory management, promotional strategies, and marketing efforts toward high-demand categories like shirts and T-shirts, while also exploring strategies to boost sales in underperforming categories.

        The monthly sales trend shows a consistent decline after April. The sharp increase observed from March to April should be interpreted with caution, as the data for March only covers a single day (March 31, 2022). This limited data creates a distorted comparison, making April appear as a significant jump in sales performance.

        From April onward, the downward trend indicates a gradual reduction in customer purchasing activity month over month, highlighting the need to further investigate potential seasonal effects, promotional factors, or changes in customer behavior during this period.

        Bengaluru remains the largest contributor to total sales. However, its performance shows a declining trend, with sales decreasing from 2.5M in April to 2.3M in both May and June. This indicates a potential challenge in sustaining growth in the city despite its market dominance.

        **Stable Second Position â€“ Hyderabad**:
        Hyderabad consistently holds the second-largest market share, maintaining relatively stable sales performance between 1.8M and 1.9M. This stability highlights Hyderabadâ€™s reliability as a steady contributor to overall sales.

        **Weaker Markets â€“ Mumbai, Chennai, and New Delhi**:
        Other cities such as Mumbai, Chennai, and New Delhi contribute less to sales compared to Bengaluru and Hyderabad. Their performance also shows a downward trend, with Mumbai being the most significant example, dropping from 1.6M in April to 1.2M in June. This decline may point to weakening customer demand or increased competition in these markets.
